# Reporting security issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository or in any of the packages used, please follow one of the options below.

- Prefer confidential reporting via GitHub Security Advisories (recommended):
  - Go to the repository on GitHub → `Security` → `Advisories` → `New draft advisory`.
  - Provide reproduction steps and a minimal reproduction case if possible.

- If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, open a private issue labeled `security` and avoid including sensitive data in the issue body.

Public disclosure

- Do not publicly disclose high-severity vulnerabilities until a fix or mitigation is available and maintainers have had time to respond.

Maintainers

- The repository uses Dependabot and CI; maintainers should prioritize merging security fixes and testing them in CI. If you are a maintainer and need help triaging, follow the steps in `DEPENDENCIES.md`.
