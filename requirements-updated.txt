# requirements-updated.txt
# Suggested dependency upgrades (draft). Verify compatibility with your CUDA/toolchain before applying.
# Apply incrementally and run tests; major upgrades may require code changes.

# Core ML stack (pick wheel that matches your CUDA runtime; CPU-only is also available)
# Example (CPU): `pip install torch torchvision -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html`
torch
torchvision
numpy

# Imaging & utils
opencv-python
pillow

# Differentiable and helper libs
kornia
pytorch-lightning

# Rendering / vector helpers
cairocffi
tensorboardx

# Drive downloader for dataset scripts
gdown

# SVG rasterization helper
cairosvg

# Notes:
# - Upgrading `torch` requires choosing a wheel built for your CUDA runtime.
# - Prefer installing `torch`/`torchvision` from the official PyTorch index matching your CUDA (see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
# - After upgrades, run `pytest` and a small end-to-end smoke run (use small input) to validate behavior.
