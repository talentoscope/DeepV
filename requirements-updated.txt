# requirements-updated.txt
# Suggested dependency upgrades (draft). Verify compatibility with your CUDA/toolchain before applying.
# Apply incrementally and run tests; major upgrades may require code changes.

# Core ML stack (pick wheel that matches your CUDA runtime; CPU-only is also available)
# Example (CPU): `pip install torch==2.1.0+cpu torchvision==0.15.2+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html`
torch==2.1.0
torchvision==0.15.2
numpy==1.25.0

# Imaging & utils
opencv-python==4.8.1
pillow==9.5.0

# Differentiable and helper libs
kornia==0.7.4
pytorch-lightning==2.0.2

# Rendering / vector helpers
cairocffi==1.3.0
tensorboardx==2.6

# Drive downloader for dataset scripts
gdown==4.7.0

# SVG rasterization helper
cairosvg==2.6.0

# Notes:
# - Upgrading `torch` requires choosing a wheel built for your CUDA runtime.
# - Prefer installing `torch`/`torchvision` from the official PyTorch index matching your CUDA (see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
# - After upgrades, run `pytest` and a small end-to-end smoke run (use small input) to validate behavior.
